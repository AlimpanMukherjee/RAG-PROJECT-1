The associative property states that for a binary operation (like addition or multiplication) defined on a set, the way in which three elements are grouped for the operation does not affect the result.

Specifically, for any three elements 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the set, the following must hold true:
(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)

This video explains this property, mentioning that it applies if you pick any three elements and the left side equals the right side.

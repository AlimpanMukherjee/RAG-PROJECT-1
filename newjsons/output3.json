If we want to study linear algebra, where the algebraic structure will be discussed, where there will be 2 sets and 1 set of operations, then it is very important to know about internal and external binary operations. So, welcome to Gate Smashers, without any delay, let's start. First of all, what is the meaning of internal binary operation?"
